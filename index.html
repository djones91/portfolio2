                            <p>Hi! I'm Daniel.</p>
                            <p>Yep: I'm rather green. Bad thing? I don't think so. I'm very keen to learn and I'll appreciate you to the moon and back if you can hold my hand a little. The web is a confusing place for a newbie.</p>
                            <p>I have a keen interest in making great looking websites, with an attention and focus on colours that pop, themes that wow and copy that inspires. I would love to work with you on your next big project and I enjoy having an opportunity to get really passionate about what I do.</p>
                            <p>I'm great with communication and have good command of both written and spoken English. I'm confident, honest and open, and I would rather proactively identify and solve a problem than wait for someone else to raise it with me. I'm never afraid to admit when I don't know something, even when I feel like I probably should.</p>
                            <p>For the last few months I have been working with a great company named TyreConnect. These guys have been nothing short of amazing in giving me my first real opportunity to step into the industry and gain some much needed experience to help me land my next big gig. While I've been working for them I've helped them gather requirements for and redesign their B2B eCommerce platform, as well as dabble in some coding work on their React and Angular applications. The portal redesign work in particular has had me engaging closely with key executives and board members within the business, their marketing and operations departments, and meeting with some big name development agencies to obtain proposals and convey our project requirements. I've planned for and conducted workshops, communicated complex needs and requirements, quickly understood the internal workings of the business and focused its key decision-makers on critical decisions required along the way. I've had awesome feedback from them and I've greatly enjoyed my time there.</p>
                            <p>Did someone say coffee? Yes. Coffee is a problem. I'm also an avid gamer (PC master race) and a crazy animal person. Don't let me talk to you about birds, because I'll probably never stop.</p>
